        I walked into my apartment after a trip to see family. As I opened the door, the smell hit me... "What is that?" I wondered. Maybe it was the heavy use of bug spray i used baking in the summer heat. I looked around and noticed in one of my bug traps a blackish blob. I got closer and noticed the shape of the lizard that was crawling around outside my place before I left for my trip. It was dead for 4 days! It was really sad and honestly a turning point for me. I was unhappy with the direction with my career and my life in general.

        With all this, I made the decision to get into programming. I didn't want to live this close to nature but how should l go about it? I didn't have internet. NOTHING! Not even Dail-up. I could use mobile data but at the time I was chasing deals. My money was tight and mobile data plans were expensive. So it was a 30-minute drive to Starbucks for great internet, a 10-minute drive to McDonalds for mediocre internet, or stay at home and do what I can with a limited data plan. It worked! For months that worked for me, switching between all options to practice, develop, and download.
        
        The journey to become a Developer was long, stressful, and at times, heart breaking but well worth it. I'm so happy that I made that decision. I have been working as a Developer for a couple of years now, moving up to mid-level, with the title of Senior Developer slowly approaching. I have learned, improved and grown so much in my career. With my love of teaching and mentoring, I want to share all the tips, tricks, and every bit of knowledge I have learned and still learning on my continued journey into programming.
